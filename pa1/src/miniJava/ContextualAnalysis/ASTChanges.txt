AST Changes:
- Add NullLiteral class and updated Visitor interface and ASTDisplay class accordingly.
- Add IDTable class to implement the HashMap of Strings and Declarations and its functionality.
- Add ScopedIdentification class to implement the Stack of IDTables and its functionality.
- Add and implement Identification class which implements the Visitor interface to traverse for identification.
- Add Declaration `declaration` field to Identifier class and implement corresponding setContext() method.
- Add boolean `isInitialized` field for VarDecl to determine if it is initialized (specifically for the int x = x + 1 case, for example).
- Add ClassDecl `associatedClass` field for MemberDecl to give context.
- Make visit methods inside visitFieldDecl and visitMethodDecl take corresponding FieldDecl/MethodDecl as context.
- Add Declaration `declaration` field to Reference class to give context for TypeChecking (helps with fewer type casts).
- Add `NULL` TypeKind to handle NullLiterals.
- Add `compareType` method to TypeDenoter to compare TypeKinds of TypeDenoters.
